Kshitij. \n\nThe opening note of this seminar was an airy one, with our beloved Albatross hovering in mid-air over the audience, who enjoyed it a lot.

In fact, there are a lot of possible innovations that one can figure out and make the best out of it if given an opportunity like the robotics events at Kshitij. This was well pointed out by making a few classic and simple robots by the members of Technology Robotix Society. Like a gesture control bot, that is literally controlled by your fingertips.
