Well, we know that cheering or supporting or standing by your team is very essential as it gives your team a boost and they tend to perform better or simply put, it takes their 'tempo' to another level. But when you find two groups of students getting into fight with each other to such an extent that police rushes to the spot to handle the situation and some students get badly injured then it's very shameful and saddening.\nWhere are we heading towards on the name of 'cheering or supporting or standing by the team'? There have been instances when Team A's supporters collectively try to 'psyche' Team B's players by using such harsh abuses that no outsider will believe for a moment that these people are actually IITians - one of the finest brains in the country! Haven't we stooped to very low when it comes to sportsman spirit? Aren't we setting very bad examples as far as our social behaviour is concerned? Haven't we forgot the difference between hooliganism and supporting?\nAs the students of one of the premier institutes of national importance, we are expected to set examples and lead from the front. The kind of behaviour that was shown yesterday wasn't even remotely close to that. That ugly altercation should have not taken place today. Students should have kept calm and shown their sportsman spirit. There are certain limits for the kind of behaviour that is appropriate for our campus. Going beyond that will only malign our institute's image and weaken the healthy bonds among students. Well, we hope that students will be more cautious to how should they react or behave.\nThere is something for us to learn from this quote by Jim Courier, \"Sportsmanship for me is when a guy walks off the court and you really can't tell whether he won or lost, when he carries himself with pride either way.\"\nLet's compete in a healthy manner and don't let such incidents happen again in future."}, {"id": "146188872068143_1407692952584389", "pic": null, "created_time": "2017-03-18T02:00:00+0000", "link": null, "message": "Whatever happened among the students on the road yesterday after the second semifinal of Inter-hall Basketball was quite unfortunate.

RK had their own share of hard luck, having two of their dead ball chances getting denied by the upright, with Sidharth missing a superbly taken free kick from the edge of the box while Sumit failing to convert a penalty. With the match closing in on the full-time whistle, Prashant of RP was sent off for being booked twice, bringing RP down to 10 men. RK bring all their men forward in the final attack of the game and score a dramatic equalizer at the end of stoppage time. RP, playing a man down, had a tough row to hoe to prevent RK from scoring in extra time and taking the game to penalties. RK stun RP with another set piece in the form of a corner, to be turned in by Ankit. Sidharth, moments later, produced a moment of magic, dazzling defenders on his way and spectacularly dribbling past them in the final third to free himself up in the box.

RP initially take the lead at the end of first half through a tap in by Suvo, after Nachiketa\u2019s effort was parried away by the goalkeeper. RK had their own share of hard luck, having two of their dead ball chances getting denied by the upright, with Sidharth missing a superbly taken free kick from the edge of the box while Sumit failing to convert a penalty. With the match closing in on the full-time whistle, Prashant of RP was sent off for being booked twice, bringing RP down to 10 men. RK bring all their men forward in the final attack of the game and score a dramatic equalizer at the end of stoppage time. RP, playing a man down, had a tough row to hoe to prevent RK from scoring in extra time and taking the game to penalties. RK stun RP with another set piece in the form of a corner, to be turned in by Ankit. Sidharth, moments later, produced a moment of magic, dazzling defenders on his way and spectacularly dribbling past them in the final third to free himself up in the box.

As a result of which the salaries of both the HMC and contractual sweeping staffs have been increased.

The decision was taken by the HMC and the Students Senate including the Vice President, Gymkhana, all Hall Presidents and the Second Senate Members. The main reasons behind this hike are stated below.\n 1.One of the major reason behind this hike is the 7th pay commission. As a result of which the salaries of both the HMC and contractual sweeping staffs have been increased. The salary of temporary workers has increased from Rs.278 per day to Rs.350 per day. \n2.One more reason behind this hike is the new policy of Tax and wage sharing. Currently, all students bear the cost towards salary and benefits of HMC employees and all outsourced sweeping workers. It has been decided that the salary of all private mess workers and tax on food served in private messes should as well be shared by all students so that those staying in halls with private mess are not disadvantaged.\n3. There is also an increase in the HOH from 300 to 600.

The decision was taken by the HMC and the Students Senate including the Vice President, Gymkhana, All Hall Presidents and the Second Senate Members.\n\nWe would like to thank Ksheera Sagar, a member of Students' Senate for explaining the increase in the fee.\n\n\"The main reason is for the increase is the 7th pay commission. The money [7950 per sem per student ] from all students is used to pay salaries of all HMC staff [297 in number] and all sweeping workers in all halls [nearly 500 in number],& to purchase all the sweeping and cleaning materials for all halls. As a result of the  pay commission, all the salaries were increased of both the HMC staff and also the contractual sweeping staff . The major chunk of the increment is due to the hike in salaries. Another component of the hike is due to the new policy of  TAX sharing and wage sharing. That means in the old policy[till now] the food tax on the food in private mess and the salary of the private mess workers in private mess were used to bear by private mess students only and also the private mess students used to bear the salary burden of HMC staff and sweeping staff as usual while the students at HMC mess use to bear only salaries of HMC staff , sweeping workers and sweeping materials. So in the policy [till now] the students at HMC mess were at an upper hand as they were not sharing any wages of private mess workers nor the HMC mess food has tax. This advantage ultimately led to the uplift of HMC meeses where comparatively good quality food is served than private messes. So according to the new policy, the tax of food in private mess will be bear by all students irrespective of HMC or private, the Mess workers salaries[HMC & private] will be bear by all students irrespective of HMC or private. and the sweeping workers salary , sweeping materials cost will be bear as usual. So the pay commission and the new policy of TAX and wage sharing makes the 7950 to 15200.\n\nThe HOH has also been increased from 300 to 600\n\nThis amount is called HOH[hall overhead fund], this is in general used to pay towards the annual maintenance of aqua guards, coolers , roti making machines, repairs of machines in mess, repair of flood lights in grounds[footer, cricket etc.] of hall, purchase of any new machines in mess, any new construction like badminton court etc and allied activities. The smaller halls with boarders strength less than 350 cannot do all the maintenance work with the HOH amount[300] obtained every sem from the students and the bigger halls with strength greater than 450 fell short in creating new facilities for their boarders like new courts, new instruments etc. So keeping all this in vision the money from 300 to 600 is increased. The HOH in every hall is controlled by warden so its allotment for maintenance and  development of the hall is entirely on the discretion of the warden."}, {"id": "146188872068143_1301416723212013", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/15403726_1301416723212013_4773174692037490929_o.jpg?oh=569019cc0abf9a67e3a6bb23c05c1d24&oe=58F480B2", "created_time": "2016-12-07T03:50:55+0000", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1301416723212013/?type=3", "message": "As per the recent circular of Hall Management Centre (HMC), all students are informed that the Hostel Overhead Charge (HOH) which is being collected from each student during semester registration has been renamed and the total fee under this category has been increased from Rs. 8,250 to Rs. 15,800.
