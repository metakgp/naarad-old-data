[{"message": "Day 6 Summary | Inter IIT Sports Meet\nAs we wrap up all the updates of live action going on field at Inter IIT Sports Meet today, it was a mixed day for IIT Kharagpur with some brilliant performances that saw them through to the next rounds and some better performances by opponent teams broke their hearts, jeopardising their campaign.\n Football Semi-Finals:\nIIT Kharagpur beats IIT Madras in the nail-biting Semi-Final by 1-0.\nWith the help of solitary goal by Abhinav Mishra, Men's Football team outplayed hosts IIT Madras by 1-0 and advanced to the finals that will be played tomorrow.\nMen's Squash team soon followed the suit and advanced to the finals by getting past the challenge of IIT Kanpur by 2-1. Its final will be played tomorrow. \nHow could Men's Badminton team stay behind? They too joined the party, completing a treble of teams qualifying for finals. Bruising aside the string challenge of IIT Delhi by 3-2, they too qualified for the finals to be played tomorrow.\nBut everything didn't go KGP's way today. Women's Badminton team suffered a heartbreaking loss to IIT Delhi by 2-1 in quarter finals and hence, losing out to get a spot in semi finals, ending their campaign.\nWomen's Tennis team encountered something similar and we're outplayed by the team that played better today. A 0-2 defeat handed to them by IIT Bombay meant their elegant journey got over which was studded with some sparkling performances in between.\nWomen's Basketball team certainly raised the bar and got something to cheer about. Whatever may the score line suggests, they didn't leave anything to turn up the game in their favour. With a score of 25-44, they lost out on the gold medal to IIT Roorkee. This silver, for sure, is no less than gold, for them, for us, for all Kgpians.\nMen's Volleyball team took on hosts IIT Madras in quarter finals and were straightway put under pressure by the opponents. They did reply back with winning the next game but couldn't hold thereafter, suffering a 1-3 loss and missing a chance to go to semi finals. For most of the games in this tournament, they had their tails up and that something they would be extremely proud of.\nMen's Basketball team was up next, taking on heavyweights IIT BHU in quarter finals. The match swinged like anything, but ended up being on our side. KGP sealed it's spot in Semi-Finals by getting past IIT BHU with a score of 57-55. \nMen's Tennis team was last in the fray for today, playing the 3rd place decider match with IIT Delhi. They put each ounce of their energy in the court but we got to admit that opponents player better. With a loss by 0-2 to IIT Delhi, IIT KGP got fourth place in Men's Tennis.\nHence, KGP stands with a total of 6 gold medals, 5 silver medals and 7 bronze medals after six days of the ongoing sports meet. We will be witnessing three final matches tomorrow. So, gear up to cheer the teams tomorrow.\nHere's the full summary of all the action that unfolded today.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1689176824435999/?type=3", "id": "146188872068143_1689177034435978", "created_time": "2017-12-21T18:49:05+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/25488466_1689176824435999_3624827567308765800_o.jpg?oh=0b6d77115eabbe9d17bf01571ffc8d8e&oe=5AB27CC5"}, {"message": "Tennis Men's Third Place Decider | Inter IIT Sports\n\nIIT Kharagpur suffered a heartbreaking loss against IIT Delhi by 0-2 (1-2, 0-2) in the well fought third place decider match and hence, couldn't get their hands on the Bronze medal.

The draw meant IIT Roorkee settled for the silver medal and hosts IIT Madras got the bronze medal. \nThroughout the tournament, IIT Kharagpur had maintained its dominance over opponents. Their journey to the title included wins over IIT BHU (4-0), IIT Kanpur (3.5-0.5), IIT Bombay (2.5-1.5), IIT (ISM) Dhanbad (3.5-0.5), IIT Guwahati (3.0-1.0), draw with IIT Roorkee (2.0-2.0) and a solitary loss to IIT Madras (1.5-2.5).\nAn impressive record of 5 wins, 1 draw and 1 loss is certainly the fruits of the mental toughness and chess acumen of all the players. But what stands out for KGP in this journey is the outstanding performance of Kaustav Chakraborty, a first-year student, who wasn't only adjudged the second best player of the tournament but also was instrumental in KGP winning the crown with 5 wins and 2 draws in his 7 games. Though he lost to Tamhankar Viraj (IIT Roorkee) by just a mere difference of 0.5 points for the title of 'Best player of the tournament', showcasing such strong chess skills at such a big stage and making opponent players bite the dust effortlessly is no mean feat! And the contingent captain Hemanth Kumar Potluri infused the much-needed confidence into the team and marshalled the troop to the glory. Prithwi, Vivek, Saurabh and Gajendra too got into the act and had fun giving opponent players a taste of their own medicine. \nTheir individual performances were as follow:\nKoustav Chakraborty - 6 points (7 games) - 5 Wins, 2 Draws\nVivek Gupta - 5 points (7 games) - 4W, 2D, 1L\nHemanth Kumar Potluri - 4 points (7 games) - 3W, 2D, 2L\nPrithwi Sinha - 2.5 points (4 games) - 2W, 1D, 1L\nSaurabh Desai - 2.5 points (3 games) - 2W, 1D\n\nThis win marks a milestone as far as Chess Culture at IIT Is concerned. It will go a long way in infusing a new life to the interests of chess enthusiasts and work harder to retain the trophy next year. Not to forget, Chess club, IIT Kharagpur has also been quite active regarding the same and the credit for this thumping win goes to all the stakeholders including players, their mentors, officials etc.\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates the entire Chess team for winning the trophy!", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/25188686_1680020208684994_1888915504441249681_o.jpg?oh=c58dfd2027bc4a482295b91536bf27fa&oe=5AD19BAD", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur is with Hemanth Kumar Potluri and 5 others.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1680020208684994/?type=3", "id": "146188872068143_1680023158684699"}, {"message": "| Important Notice |\nHere is the mail that has been circulated by the CIC warning the students against a recent mass mail that is being considered as a security threat and the students need to remain cautious about the same.

I have personally thanked our Director, IIT Kharagpur for being the part of the Open House session till the end and helping us resolve all the facts.\n\nWe had several meetings with different stakeholders to have an immediate action plan for our problems and prepared a thorough list of solutions. The attached action plan contains the suggestions of ours and the Director. I have tried to give few insights in each of the step giving you more clarity on the same.\n\nACTION ITEMS\n\nThe following points are references to the pdf attached. Kindly go through following points after going through pdf.\n\n1) As asked by few students in the Open House session, the Director has agreed for the external inquiry to be set up. He has himself talked to a retired judge of High Court for the same. However, on expressing concern from our side regarding the problems students involved in the event may face, the Director assured by saying that it will be tried to reduce the friction as much as possible.\n2) For the medical audit of BCRTH an expert committee will be appointed in 15 days, panel which would consist of about 2 male and 1 female doctor. We are expecting the audit to be done by the end of December.\n3) A complain portal with a complain escalation mechanism is being prepared. The basic feature of the complain portal will be prepared by us which would then be reviewed and improvised by the B C Roy Technology authorities. We are expecting the portal to be implemented by next week.\n4) Digitalization of B C Roy Hospital: We have proposed to make all the process of a normal visit of a student to BCRTH digitalized. This will include taking an appointment online, making a student's profile containing all the details of previous visits. Digitalization will remove all the ledger related work and will involve the least paper work. We are also trying to incorporate this in ERP helping students in a systematic approach towards the health issues. It will take about 3 months for the finalization.\n5) BCRTH has been stocked with certain life-saving items like anti-venom, anti-rabies etc and other items like clothes to be reviewed in one week. It has been done to equip the hospital 24*7 prepared to tackle few emergency issues.\n6) Regarding the public statement from the Institute, the Director has shared the Open House video from his personal Facebook page.\n7) We are taking a lot of initiatives by conducting several events for mental well being and also training G Sec Student Welfare Council, TSG and Student Welfare Group. For the same, an annual calendar list will be prepared and will be followed every year.\n8) A Dean's Council is being formed to assist Dean, SA and to tackle more student affairs.\n9) For a better fire emergency solutions, a plan is being developed by the security to have fire drill and checking the quality of extinguishers.\n10) One Annual Health Checkup (not mandatory) whose expenses will be integrated with medical insurances.\n11) Tie-ups with Railway hospitals are being made to handle more cases locally.\n12) A framework will be planned by December to develop a regulatory mechanism to assess the performance of BCRTH and Counselling Centre throughout the year.\n13) One Extra Academic Activity to be incorporated in already existing EAA system, National Cultural Organization. Technology Students' Gymkhana in association with SANDHI and Happiness Centre will be working on the same.\n\nStatus of ongoing action items have also been listed in the pdf. I urge you all to stay concerned about the progress of these points as they are of dire need, I will be more than happy to update you about any further development (ping me anytime). As I have stated in my earlier mail also that we, as a student community is also at fault somewhere as you can observe lack of interaction between seniors and even batch-mates, we need to revive our culture which is the core of our development and for the same I will communicate feasible action plan soon.

We kept everything in the raw format so that the students could judge for themselves which claims are true, or what answers are satisfactory. We encourage everyone to raise any point from that report in the Open House in case they are unsatisfied. \n\n2. Questionnaire distribution to admin and students\nThe objective of the Open House is to get clear cut answers out in the open to pressing questions and queries in the students\u2019 minds. This was the reason behind floating the questionnaire to the student community in advance. However, to prevent anyone from getting away from answering a difficult question by a simple \u2018we will look into it and get back to you\u2019, we think it is important that they receive a copy of the questions beforehand and come prepared to face the students. We will release the same copy to the students as well.\n\n3. Selection/Filtering of questions by Senate for Open House This was the most disheartening impression held by the students communicated to us. As the Senate, we are always on the students\u2019 side. We have been working hard to compile all questions collected by Awaaz\u2019s and the VP\u2019s survey. We want to finalize a repository of questions that cover different aspects of the issues at hand. We hope you can trust us enough to not tamper with the questions and let difficult ones be skipped by anyone. The major part of the session is for students to ask questions directly, a report of which will be compiled and again sent to everyone.\n\n4. Conversation with Mr Raghuvanshi, ASP\nThe purpose of visiting him and sharing the conversation was to bring out a missing perspective regarding the situation. We identified his to be a unique standpoint having closely seen both incidents people have been talking about. However, we were unable to frame our interaction to portray the same intention. By no means was that document a hidden threat against protests, a way to shift blame or even an attempt to absolve the status of B.C. Roy\u2019s facilities. We apologize for any anger or dissatisfaction caused due to our inability to recreate the conversation for you. No one can stop you to express yourself through peaceful protests.

A repeat of what happened back in 2009 can have some regretful consequences for some people, and we do not want that to happen to anyone unnecessarily. \n\n5. Limiting the session to only B.C.R.H and Counseling Centre\nTo fulfil the objective of getting concrete solutions and directed answers, it is extremely necessary to keep asking questions that are on point. Diversifying the topic might lead to the focus being shifted, or people getting lost in the conversation. We will have other similar sessions in the future to tackle other issues. We hope you will show similar fervour towards them as well. \n\n6. Action plan \nThe student community is filled with anger and sorrow. It is important to channel these emotions productively. We plan to use this session to put up our demands. The administration is given an ultimatum to come up with the solutions, and the plan for implementation.

And when someone finally came to clean up the wound, they were harsh and gave me a lecture having disturbed their sleep.\nAnother time, during the vacations, I had stitches in my ear which I requested to be checked and removed when ready. The removal was postponed by almost a week saying my wound hasn't healed which resulted in my wound getting septic due to inadequate cleaning. The stitch removal process in the septic state was extremely painful and when requested for a surface anaesthetic, I was told that it was a long procedure for allowance. So, I should \"MAN UP\".\n\nExperience 2:\nI was suffering from viral fever and the medicines prescribed by the initial examination couldn't cure me. As it worsened, I was hospitalised after 10 days. In the hospital, I was given high dosages of antibiotic (1000 mg) along with saline drip regularly. This was the first time I was given a drip (completely unnecessary).\nAfter 2 days, my condition worsened with my temperature reaching up to 103 F.

My parents arrived the very next morning and I forcefully got myself discharged and taken to my hometown. I was there given no antibiotic, just some Vicks tablet and Dabur Honitus as the infection was in my throat which the BC Roy doctors couldn't find out. I became completely fine and came back to college in 5 days.\n\nExperience 3:\nI have a disease called migraine. Once, I reached B.C. Roy with a major attack of migraine and at the same time, they were handling a critical case of some other person. I was crying like anything. No one was ready to take my complaint while I literary cried in front of them. But no one was helping me, may be due to that critical case. I didn't want doctors to pay attention towards me instead of that critical case but I wanted them to have a sufficient number of emergency doctors to treat 12,000 KGPians.\n\nExperience 4:\nDuring my second year, I and my friend met with an accident. We went to the hospital late night and the doctor who was on the night shift in the emergency section said this to us - \"Yeh koi time hai aane ka\" **Is this a proper time to come to the hospital?** Later, after getting an X-ray, I got to know that I might be having a fracture on scaphoid bone. He wanted to confirm. So, he recommended 'another' X-ray and told me to come after a week because he won't be available.

And yet, nobody talks about it \u2013 a taboo among more mundane and everyday topics. The myths, such as, a menstruating woman is dirty and impure, that she cannot worship, that when she touches a tree, it wilts and that can she cannot lead a normal life during that phase are baseless, for it\u2019s not the inner you but only the biology that is changing. Let us accept that menstrual blood is pure, sacred and respect women for being blessed with the power to give birth.\nAs Manu from Hindu Mythology says in Manusmriti, \u201cYatra Naryastu Pujyante, Ramanti Tatra Devtaha, Yatraitaastu Na Pujyante, Savastatra Afalaha Kriyaha\u201d\nWhich means \u2018the divine are extremely happy where women are respected, but where they are not, all actions, however good and holy, are fruitless\u2019. Let's talk about menstruation freely, not as if it's a taboo and let the flower of fertility blossom.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22713552_1629064807113868_4459757730606779719_o.jpg?oh=b9ecc73a07c8c33bb0d79aa9c60044f6&oe=5A746BE6", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 2 new photos \u2014 with Lavisha Parab and 11 others.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1629064807113868/?type=3", "id": "146188872068143_1629066287113720"}, {"created_time": "2017-10-23T15:10:12+0000", "message": "Just a few days ago, IIT Kharagpur\u200b saw best of the Rangolis on the occasion of Diwali celebrations.

The questions were already being raised about the steps taken by the administration to curb the suicides after the campus saw 4 suicides on a trot in the campus last semester but today's incident unearths and points out towards some serious and major loopholes in the existing setup. \n\nFor the reasons understandable, we will not be mentioning any names here.\n\nAs per the information that we have got, the attempt of committing suicide took place around 10:50 am today in LBS hall when the student jumped from the 4th floor of the hall building. He was not a resident of LBS hall of residence. As soon as people found out, they called the ambulance. So, he was soon taken to the hospital in the ambulance. On seeing the student\u2019s condition, BC Roy Technology Hospital referred him to Kolkata.  The ambulance left the campus around 12:10 pm in the noon after completing all the paperwork where the student accompanying him was asked to get the signatures of the warden and a lot of other paperwork which almost took 40 minutes. In the meantime, there was a problem with the lights of the ambulance. So, another ambulance was called. Also, there was another delay of almost 10-15 minutes as the attendant was out of reach. During this time, as the pulse was near zero, the hospital people gave some injections and initial treatment to stabilize his pulse to 40-50. If they wouldn't have done it then he might have passed away right then. So it took nearly 25-30 minutes to stabilize the pulse. And finally, the ambulance left the campus around 12:10 pm.  The ambulance was accompanied by 2 escorts to Kolkata. Two of his friends with the Hall Manager, two attendants, and the doctor were in the ambulance. The driver misjudged a path to the hospital which further worsened the situation. As told by the accompanying students, the behavior of the hospital staff raised a lot of questions as they were not very supportive. The oxygen masks and the drips got mishandled and they were not able to fix it properly again. Prior to some 15-20 minutes before reaching the hospital, ambulance broke down and they were left in a miserable condition.  The students tried to get another vehicle. After a while and a lot of efforts of the students and the policeman accompanying them, a Tata Ace owner agreed to take them to the hospital. As soon as the additional SP and the Director got this news, they informed the hospital at the other end and an ambulance was started in a reverse way to attend the case, but as the ambulance came to the spot, they saw nobody and they got information that they have left using some other source.

Therefore, results for the Illumination category haven't been declared.\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratultes each and every member of the KGP community who, despite the adversities, made this celebration a grand success!", "link": null, "id": "146188872068143_1625483590805323", "created_time": "2017-10-19T18:58:38+0000", "pic": null}, {"message": "\u0926\u0940\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0916\u0941\u0936\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092f\u0947 \u0939\u0930 \u091c\u0917\u0939 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u0935\u0932\u093f\u0924 \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0964 \u0906\u0935\u093e\u095b, \u0906\u0908\u0906\u0908\u091f\u0940 \u0916\u095c\u0917\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0913\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092a\u093e\u0935\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0964", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1625133154173700/?type=3", "id": "146188872068143_1625133287507020", "created_time": "2017-10-19T10:18:26+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22499265_1625133154173700_5520948010347294762_o.jpg?oh=fee8787d9082121d47bc58373e113a08&oe=5A39CA92"}, {"message": "\u0926\u0940\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0916\u0941\u0936\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092f\u0947 \u0939\u0930 \u091c\u0917\u0939 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u0935\u0932\u093f\u0924 \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0964 \u0906\u0935\u093e\u095b, \u0906\u0908\u0906\u0908\u091f\u0940 \u0916\u095c\u0917\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0913\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092a\u093e\u0935\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0964", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1625133154173700/?type=3", "id": "146188872068143_1625133287507020", "created_time": "2017-10-19T10:18:26+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22499265_1625133154173700_5520948010347294762_o.jpg?oh=fee8787d9082121d47bc58373e113a08&oe=5A39CA92"}, {"message": "\u0926\u0940\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0916\u0941\u0936\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092f\u0947 \u0939\u0930 \u091c\u0917\u0939 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u0935\u0932\u093f\u0924 \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0964 \u0906\u0935\u093e\u095b, \u0906\u0908\u0906\u0908\u091f\u0940 \u0916\u095c\u0917\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0913\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092a\u093e\u0935\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0964", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1625133154173700/?type=3", "id": "146188872068143_1625133287507020", "created_time": "2017-10-19T10:18:26+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22499265_1625133154173700_5520948010347294762_o.jpg?oh=fee8787d9082121d47bc58373e113a08&oe=5A39CA92"}, {"message": "\u0926\u0940\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0916\u0941\u0936\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092f\u0947 \u0939\u0930 \u091c\u0917\u0939 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u0935\u0932\u093f\u0924 \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0964 \u0906\u0935\u093e\u095b, \u0906\u0908\u0906\u0908\u091f\u0940 \u0916\u095c\u0917\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0913\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092a\u093e\u0935\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0964", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1625133154173700/?type=3", "id": "146188872068143_1625133287507020", "created_time": "2017-10-19T10:18:26+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22499265_1625133154173700_5520948010347294762_o.jpg?oh=fee8787d9082121d47bc58373e113a08&oe=5A39CA92"}, {"message": "\"It takes years of hard work to build a tradition like Illumination, but it takes nothing to let it decay into the oblivion\", that's what Prof. Somesh Kumar (Dean of Student Affairs, IIT Kharagpur) said when asked about Illumination.

For KGP, Illu is Diwali and Diwali is Illu. For the freshers who will be going to witness this trademark celebration of Diwali for the first time, they must be feeling intrigued when they find the air buzzing with \u2018illu\u2019. They must be having such questions in their mind like what is it? What\u2019s so special about it? What for our seniors are working so hard? is that effort worth it? And all.

Each model had about 36-46 cubes of 10 cm sides which were joined to form the Illumination.\nThe project was supervised by Teaching Assistants Mr. Deepanjan Saha and Ms. Vidhu Vinod Bhushan.\n\nWe appreciate this unique and monumental effort of the students and believe that it will take the 'Illumination' culture to new heights!", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22549787_1624248814262134_6253665993296043687_n.jpg?oh=663cdeff09271e93b9dbd2cd6b5fa703&oe=5A87AA80", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 12 new photos.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1624248814262134/?type=3", "id": "146188872068143_1624259674261048"}, {"created_time": "2017-10-18T10:55:37+0000", "message": "The official schedule and route for the Illumination and Rangoli has been released. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur wishes the KGPians all the best as they put in their best efforts to make this Illumination a life-time memory.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22490209_1624190777601271_769790864185685294_n.jpg?oh=121ea469760005cbc825c2c4c3036fa4&oe=5A7A5960", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 2 new photos.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.991636374190051.1073741851.146188872068143/1624190777601271/?type=3", "id": "146188872068143_1624190824267933"}, {"created_time": "2017-10-18T10:55:37+0000", "message": "The official schedule and route for the Illumination and Rangoli has been released. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur wishes the KGPians all the best as they put in their best efforts to make this Illumination a life-time memory.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22490209_1624190777601271_769790864185685294_n.jpg?oh=121ea469760005cbc825c2c4c3036fa4&oe=5A7A5960", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 2 new photos.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.991636374190051.1073741851.146188872068143/1624190777601271/?type=3", "id": "146188872068143_1624190824267933"}, {"created_time": "2017-10-18T10:55:37+0000", "message": "The official schedule and route for the Illumination and Rangoli has been released. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur wishes the KGPians all the best as they put in their best efforts to make this Illumination a life-time memory.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22490209_1624190777601271_769790864185685294_n.jpg?oh=121ea469760005cbc825c2c4c3036fa4&oe=5A7A5960", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 2 new photos.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.991636374190051.1073741851.146188872068143/1624190777601271/?type=3", "id": "146188872068143_1624190824267933"}, {"created_time": "2017-10-18T10:55:37+0000", "message": "The official schedule and route for the Illumination and Rangoli has been released. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur wishes the KGPians all the best as they put in their best efforts to make this Illumination a life-time memory.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22490209_1624190777601271_769790864185685294_n.jpg?oh=121ea469760005cbc825c2c4c3036fa4&oe=5A7A5960", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 2 new photos.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.991636374190051.1073741851.146188872068143/1624190777601271/?type=3", "id": "146188872068143_1624190824267933"}, {"created_time": "2017-10-18T10:55:37+0000", "message": "The official schedule and route for the Illumination and Rangoli has been released. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur wishes the KGPians all the best as they put in their best efforts to make this Illumination a life-time memory.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22490209_1624190777601271_769790864185685294_n.jpg?oh=121ea469760005cbc825c2c4c3036fa4&oe=5A7A5960", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 2 new photos.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.991636374190051.1073741851.146188872068143/1624190777601271/?type=3", "id": "146188872068143_1624190824267933"}, {"created_time": "2017-10-17T18:16:34+0000", "message": "Haven't you got into the groove of 'Diwali' celebrations yet?

But a journey worth documenting!\nFrom earning accolades like \u201cThe Nerve of KGP\u201d, \u201cThe Voice of KGP\u201d, and many more to always striving to deliver on the expectations in the best way possible, Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur has come a long way, thanks to the unsung efforts of the league of Awaaz ex-chief editors and ex-editors and the current team members as well. This video recognises their efforts, albeit not all, as all those efforts along with the emotions and the craving for the betterment of KGP community is not too easy to depict. Watch out for how Awaaz has made impact in the campus; be it keeping KGP well-informed, or covering issues which need immediate attention from the administration as well (Security issue, Fee hike issue, Issue of cumbersome CV module last year), or running campaigns (Save Electricity Campaign, Clean KGP Campaign), or active reporting on passport bribery issue in the passport office resulting in immediate halt to such malpractices, and many more. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur has always been and will always remain committed to its objective of the betterment of KGP community and sticking to the core values of Constructive journalism.

But a journey worth documenting!\nFrom earning accolades like \u201cThe Nerve of KGP\u201d, \u201cThe Voice of KGP\u201d, and many more to always striving to deliver on the expectations in the best way possible, Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur has come a long way, thanks to the unsung efforts of the league of Awaaz ex-chief editors and ex-editors and the current team members as well. This video recognises their efforts, albeit not all, as all those efforts along with the emotions and the craving for the betterment of KGP community is not too easy to depict. Watch out for how Awaaz has made impact in the campus; be it keeping KGP well-informed, or covering issues which need immediate attention from the administration as well (Security issue, Fee hike issue, Issue of cumbersome CV module last year), or running campaigns (Save Electricity Campaign, Clean KGP Campaign), or active reporting on passport bribery issue in the passport office resulting in immediate halt to such malpractices, and many more. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur has always been and will always remain committed to its objective of the betterment of KGP community and sticking to the core values of Constructive journalism.

But a journey worth documenting!\nFrom earning accolades like \u201cThe Nerve of KGP\u201d, \u201cThe Voice of KGP\u201d, and many more to always striving to deliver on the expectations in the best way possible, Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur has come a long way, thanks to the unsung efforts of the league of Awaaz ex-chief editors and ex-editors and the current team members as well. This video recognises their efforts, albeit not all, as all those efforts along with the emotions and the craving for the betterment of KGP community is not too easy to depict. Watch out for how Awaaz has made impact in the campus; be it keeping KGP well-informed, or covering issues which need immediate attention from the administration as well (Security issue, Fee hike issue, Issue of cumbersome CV module last year), or running campaigns (Save Electricity Campaign, Clean KGP Campaign), or active reporting on passport bribery issue in the passport office resulting in immediate halt to such malpractices, and many more. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur has always been and will always remain committed to its objective of the betterment of KGP community and sticking to the core values of Constructive journalism.

But what did actually happen? \nThey outplayed IIT Guwahati by 11-0, beat the favourites i.e., host IIT Madras by 5-4 and drew valiantly with IIT Bombay by 4-4. In semifinal, they made a mockery of it by winning it with a score of 10-2.\nIn finals, they were lagging behind with a score of 2-3. And not to forget, they were two times defending champions! Chips were down. The chances of winning the gold again looked bleak. But that's exactly when they bounced back in style to make a stunning comeback and levelled the score! It went down to penalties. They were still in the game and did a brilliant job by holding the opposition on tie, given that opposition had one of the best goalkeepers of the tournament. It then went down to 'sudden death' and they lost it by just a whisker!\nDoes the story end here? No, certainly not! They gave it their everything, every ounce of energy that their body had, every drop of sweat that they could have offered and showcased indomitable will, grit, determination and strength! It was the culmination of hours long practice sessions and rigorous training schedules.\nAnd it's not only the Water Polo team, it has been the same with all other members of our contingent. They all have tried their best and left no stones unturned in bringing laurels to KGP. Be it silver or bronze or even no medal, it's not the medals for which they deserve applause, it's their sincere efforts that deserves tonnes of pats on their backs! \nLet's take a moment and appreciate what they have achieved and accomplished. Let's applaud their collective efforts irrespective of what's the colour of the medal. \nWe all KGPians are indeed proud of you all, team KGP! Well done!", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22219807_1612590088761340_6473667869155620886_o.jpg?oh=5de4efd4a18dea9a48caa04e21ade68b&oe=5A843529", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur is with Soham Chandorkar and 8 others.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1612590088761340/?type=3", "id": "146188872068143_1612644642089218"}, {"created_time": "2017-10-05T16:01:58+0000", "message": "What do you see in this picture?

The next round is scheduled for September 24th.\n\n1) Prepare with a codelab (duration ~2-3 hours)\nWe've prepared a small codelab (a tutorial combining explanation, working example code, and code exercise) to cover some basic algorithms which will help in the upcoming Code Jam Kickstart (CJK) rounds. Even if you do not plan to participate in the upcoming rounds, the codelab should help brush up basics for other algorithmic contests and interviews. \n\nFor the codelab, you would need an internet connection and basic programming skills in a language of your choice, and of course, a little enthusiasm and energy to get through the codelab. We recommend having facilitators (a faculty or a fellow student) who can help if needed, and pursue the codelab as a group exercise. If you're a facilitator, it would be nice to brush up some combinatorics, dynamic programming (DP) and geometry skills. The time it would take a student to finish the codelab would depend on their current understanding and skill, but to err on the safe side, be ready to put in 2-3 hours.\n\n2) Sign-up for the Codelab by 20th Sep\nPlease sign-up via this form ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXuYa3JLlJPSd7xkyVpflIwiqwjsg9TPo9WSCenthdDEG6nQ/viewform ) and we will send you the codelab material via email.

The stadium experienced decent turnout of the crowd cheering for their Halls of Residence. Yesterday, it all started with Junior Men & Women events in 800 meters. SN Hall of Residence performed exceptionally well by bagging a total of 3 medals in Junior Women category. MS Hall, the defending champions of GC Athletics Men, left everyone speechless by securing a total of 5 medals, all the three in the senior category and gold & silver in the junior category. Manish Singh Rana (MMM Hall) managed to win the gold for his hall of residence in both 800 m and 1500 m. Lokesh Reddi and Gaurav Shenoy were among the few names who secured medals in every event they participated and left no stone unturned to contribute towards the sport. Among girls, Bharti Kushal Sharma, Dimple Kapadia, and Hima Swetha showed outstanding performances. In Men JR category, Sagar Kongari, Eslavatha Jaga Deesh, and Sumit Gaurav have shown exceptional performances by winning more than one medal for their respective halls.\n\nMS Hall continues its legacy in GC Athletics by scoring a sum of 53 points on Day 1 and Day 2. According to the current tally of points, the competition for the third position is too fierce with the difference of just one point between RP (14 Points) and LBS (13 Points). In GC Athletics women\u2019s category, SN Hall of Residence is leading others with 30 points. Junior events, however, with the contribution of no points in General Championship, were also quite successful with the active participation in Men\u2019s category.\n\nWith the showcase of such fine performances, we expect the events will exhibit the same enthusiasm and sportsmanship and Day 3 will witness wonders.

We, on the behalf of entire campus, would also like to thank Zakir Khan from the core of our hearts for taking out some time of his busy schedule and making this campus livelier with his presence.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/21316320_1585006634853019_7923472083901736591_o.jpg?oh=412e10a2244b7882178b7d963a63891c&oe=5A216E1A", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 5 new photos.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1585006634853019/?type=3", "id": "146188872068143_1585010204852662"}, {"message": "OPEN IIT 2017-18 || DUMB CHARADES   \nThe Open IIT Dumb Charades Competition is scheduled to be held on 7th September in F-127 from 6:30 pm onwards.

Same goes for IIT Patna with Rs. 8.36 crores.\n\n3) Avoidable expenditure towards penal charges on electricity consumption: IIT Madras had incurred an avoidable expenditure of Rs. 1.05 crores towards penalty for exceeding contracted demand during April 2013 to March 2016 due to non-review and enhancement of sanctioned demand.\n\n4) Irregular waiver of overpayment: The Board of Governors of IIT Jodhpur irregularly waived recovery of excess payment amounting to Rs. 59.38 lakhs made to its faculty, which is now under recovery at the instance of Audit.\n\n5) Irregular reimbursement of LTC (Leave Travel Concession) claims by Central Autonomous Bodies: Central Autonomous Bodies irregularly reimbursed air fares of Rs. 6.90 crores during 2012-16 against the air tickets purchased by their employees from unauthorised agents in violation of the MoF guidelines for availing Leave Travel Concession. IIT Kharagpur, despite delayed submission of claims, did not recover LTC advance of Rs. 1.14 crore of which Rs. 19.85 lakh was to be forfeited.
